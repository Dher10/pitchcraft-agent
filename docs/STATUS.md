## Session log

### 2026-10-10 — Audit (Claude chat)

- Full history scan: no secrets in any commit or branch. `.env*` and `*.pem` ignored.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: 1 critical (next), 4 high, 1 moderate; all fixed by Next 16.4.0. Practical exposure low (static site: no middleware, Server Actions or `next/image`), fixed anyway in P0.9.
- Stray `pitchcraftvisualpolish.bundle` committed in `5a8c5cc`; `pybaseball` unpinned; no test infrastructure.
- Added P0.0, P0.9, P1.0, P1.8, P1.9; reordered P0.4/P0.5; decisions D15–D19.

### 2026-10-10 — Planning (Claude chat)

- Audited v1 code. Findings recorded in `PLAN.md` Phase 0: demo `recent_form`/bio leaking into live starters; count-based labels with duplicated logic; no sample thresholds; season-to-date fetches cause leakage for historical games; Critic does not read report text; name-split bug; silent fallback to demo.
- Verified MLB Stats API: player profile includes birth city/state/country, draft records (year, team, round, school) and MLB debut date; schedule includes series description, game number and series status. Past series status shows the final result, so it needs an `as_of` rebuild for historical cases.
- Created `PRD_v2.md`, `eval-spec.md`, `DECISIONS.md` (D1–D14; D15–D19 added in the audit), `PLAN.md`, this file and the new `AGENTS.md`.
